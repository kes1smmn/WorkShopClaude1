## Backup Plans

### If Network Issues
- Use pre-cloned repo
- Show screenshots of expected output
- Focus on prompt crafting discussion

### If Bedrock Down
- Switch to discussing prompting strategies
- Review existing code in repo
- "Whiteboard" the architecture

### If Docker Issues
- Run backend/frontend without Docker
- `cd backend && python app.py`
- `cd frontend && npm run dev`
